## Description

  This README.md generator is designed to ensure that a read me file is generated using a format that is widely accepted in software/application development. This application is geared toward those who are just starting out in coding and are not sure how to format or even if they have the right content for their README files.  

  User Story  
  
  AS A developer I WANT an automated README file  generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project  

  Acceptance Criteria  

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

## Usage

  Once the application is running answer the questions that generate i.e. "What is the Name of your project?.  Be sure that you enter all information that is asked before hitting enter. (Very important note if you have a lot of information to present). *At this time you will have manually enter any screenshots you want to add, this will be a quick follow on tech debt to correct.
